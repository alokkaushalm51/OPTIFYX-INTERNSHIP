# IRIS FLOWER CLASSIFICATION PROJECT
# Project Overview
This project aims to classify Iris flowers into three species—Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica—using a machine learning model. The classification is based on sepal and petal measurements (length and width). The dataset is a well-known benchmark dataset in machine learning, and the goal is to build an efficient and accurate classification model.

### How to Run the Project
**1.Download the Dataset:** Ensure that the dataset is saved as `iris.csv` in the same directory as the script or update the file path in the code accordingly.

**2.Run the Python Script:** Execute the `iris_classification.py` script to perform the following steps:
- Data loading and preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations
- Model training and evaluation
- Hyperparameter tuning for optimal performance
- Final evaluation on the test dataset

### Command to execute:
```
python iris_classification.py
```

**3.Output:**
- EDA visualizations (e.g., pairplot and correlation heatmap).
- Best-performing models and their hyperparameters.
- Classification metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score) for the test dataset.

## Key Features
**1.Data Preprocessing:**
- Missing value handling.
- Feature standardization for improved model performance.

**2.Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
- Pairplot to visualize feature distributions by species.
- Correlation heatmap to understand relationships between features.

**3Model Training:**
- Two machine learning models: Random Forest and Support Vector Machines (SVM).
- Hyperparameter optimization using GridSearchCV.

**4.Performance Evaluation:**
- Metrics include accuracy, classification report, and confusion matrix.

# Project Results
- Both Random Forest and SVM models achieved high accuracy (97–99%) on the test dataset.
- The EDA revealed clear separability for Setosa, while Versicolor and Virginica showed slight overlap in feature space.

# Future Improvements
- Explore additional machine learning models (e.g., Gradient Boosting, Neural Networks).
- Use feature selection techniques to improve model interpretability.
- Experiment with ensemble techniques for further performance improvements.

# Dataset Source
- The Iris dataset is publicly available and commonly used for classification tasks in machine learning.
